There are a number of parts you can 3D print for your Electric Eel Wheel 6.0 e-spinner. You might decide to print these are replacement parts, increase bobbin storage, or to replace some parts with some new colors.

Bobbins
For each bobbin you will need to print the bobbin_disk1.stl, bobbin_disk2.stl and bobbin_tube.stl. You also need to have two R6-2RS bearings: https://www.mcmaster.com/60355K703

After printing the parts you put the bearings into the disks and then screw the disks onto the tubes. The disk1 part requires supports.

Bobbin Release Dial
This part requires an M6x1 machine screw. Here is one that would work: https://www.mcmaster.com/92005A422

Bottom
This part covers the bottom and can hold a TalentCell 12V/6000mAh battery pack. You can reuse the screws and rubber feet from the bottom that came with the EEW 6.0.

Flyer Arm Caps
This part clicks onto the end of the flyer arms.

Reducer
This part fits into the orifice hole on the front of your EEW 6.0. It helps reduce the yarn wobble when spinning thin yarn. After printing you may need to sand it's diameter slightly to make it fit better, or if the fit is too loose put a piece of tape around it to make the fit more snug.

Quill
This allows an alternative method of spinning on the EEW 6.0. This connects in the same way as the Reducer. Explaining how you actually spin using this is beyond the scope of this document. Modified it to be a better design based on feedback.

Tension Dial
You can reuse the screw and spring that came with your original tension dial.
